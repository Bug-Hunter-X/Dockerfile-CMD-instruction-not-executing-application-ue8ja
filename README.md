# Dockerfile CMD Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the `CMD` instruction fails to execute the application correctly. The issue stems from an incorrect or incomplete command specified in the `CMD` instruction, often due to a missing entry point script or incorrect command arguments.

## Bug

The original `Dockerfile` uses `CMD ["npm", "start"]`, expecting the application to start automatically.  However, this often fails if the package.json lacks an appropriate start script or the start script is not executable from the current context.

## Solution

The solution provides a revised `Dockerfile` with an explicit entrypoint script (e.g., `start.sh`) and a corrected `CMD` invocation to ensure successful execution.
